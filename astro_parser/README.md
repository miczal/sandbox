astro_parser
===============

Parser for trajectories from Heavens Above website. It was meant to be used to track objects in the night sky,
but my camera is too weak to see anything in complete darkness and there seems to be no free sky stream available as an alternative...
Very basic version, it will be useful for my website.

Usage is pretty straight forward - input latitude and longitude of an observation point. Now it's just ISS trajectories.
